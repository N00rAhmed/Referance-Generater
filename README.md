  Python Reference Genrator
</h1>

This is a python automation program which creates a referance for the user by just adding the URL of the web page used for a research paper, homework, assignment etc.

Currently this script generates a havard reference but this will soon also have other referencing styles integrated into it. The purpose of this project is to make life easier for students because creating references is a boring and tedious task.

This will not only save time but also reduce the frustration of students.
